<h1>Top 3 Favorite Movies by Chester</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but "The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>One of the great mafia film I have ever watched, you will learn family,power and friendship that you have to trust</p>
<h3>The notebook</h3>
<p>One of the greatest love story I watched</p>
